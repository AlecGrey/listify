## Description

This application was developed to practice Ruby on Rails fundamentals, and also as a proof of concept for a grocery-list builder application.  The current application will allow a user to create an account, and from their user interface they can create grocery lists, and add recipes to their grocery list.  These meal recipes will have a list of ingredients, and by adding them to their grocery list, it will accumulate all the ingredients into an organized list.  

Future functionality should include:
- Utilize grocery and meal recipe APIs
- Creating, reading, updating, and destroying custom recipes
- Match food items with grocery items from API to determine cost estimates for grocery trip
- Increased grocery-list functionality, such as custom names, a more robust interface, and the ability to generate a printable PDF
- Mobile functionality
